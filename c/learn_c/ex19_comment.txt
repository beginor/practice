I use Debian 6, when  trying to make ex19, I got the following error:

make ex19
cc -Wall -g   -c -o object.o object.c
cc1: error: object.c: Value too large for defined data type
make: *** [object.o] Error 1

but the code can be compiled and run under osx.

Its a pleasure to read you book, thanks!
